# Bar Till Simulator
This is a simple simulator to help you practice using a bar till.
You can use the buttons to add items to your order, remove items, and complete the order.

# Extra
This project is work in progress and currently has no functionality. <br>
My reasoning behind this project is to provide new staff members a way to learn how to use the till system. Additonally, I am using this opportunity to learn how to use React.js
